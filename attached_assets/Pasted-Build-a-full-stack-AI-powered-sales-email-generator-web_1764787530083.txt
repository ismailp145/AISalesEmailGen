Build a full-stack AI-powered sales email generator web app that works like a lightweight HubSpot / ZoomInfo Copilot for Basho-style outreach.

## High-level behavior

- The app lets a user:
  - Paste a single prospect email + LinkedIn URL, OR
  - Upload a CSV of many prospects (name, title, company, email, LinkedIn URL, optional notes)
- For each prospect, the app:
  - Fetches/scrapes the LinkedIn profile URL (or searches LinkedIn by name + company if URL is missing) to collect:
    - Current role and company
    - Recent activity signals (job changes, promotions, funding news, product launches, tech stack mentions)
    - Industry and company size
  - Uses an AI model (call OpenAI API placeholder) to generate a ZoomInfo-style Basho email:
    - Clear subject line
    - Personalized trigger hook referencing something specific from LinkedIn/company
    - 2–3 sentence Consequence of Inaction (COI) statement
    - 1–2 sentence value proposition tailored to their role
    - Specific CTA with 2–3 time options
- The user can:
  - Preview/edit the generated emails in a clean UI
  - Select one or many rows and click “Send”
  - On send, the backend uses a dummy email provider function (abstracted email service) that can later be wired to real SMTP/SendGrid

## Tech stack

- Frontend:
  - React (TypeScript) with a modern component-based architecture
  - Routing with React Router (single-page app feel)
  - State management with React Query or simple Context where appropriate
- Backend:
  - Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
  - REST API endpoints for:
    - `/api/generate-email` (single prospect)
    - `/api/generate-batch` (CSV batch)
    - `/api/send-email` (single or batch)
- CSV handling:
  - Support CSV upload on the frontend
  - Parse on the frontend and send JSON to backend, or upload to backend and parse there using a library like `papaparse` or `csv-parser`
- AI integration:
  - Create a service layer that calls an OpenAI-style completion/chat API (use environment variable for API key)
  - Centralize the Basho prompt template in one file
- LinkedIn enrichment:
  - Create a `linkedinService.ts` with functions that:
    - Given `linkedinUrl`, return mock structured data
    - Given `name + company`, return mock structured data
  - Implement this as placeholder/mock functions (no real scraping), but design the types and flow so real enrichment logic can be plugged in later

## Core user flows

1. **Single email flow**
   - Landing page with two main options:
     - “Generate 1:1 Email”
     - “Bulk Campaign via CSV”
   - For “Generate 1:1 Email”:
     - Simple form with:
       - Prospect name
       - Company
       - Title
       - Email
       - LinkedIn URL
       - Optional “notes/context” textarea
     - Button: “Generate Basho Email”
     - Show loading state
     - Display result in a rich text area / code-like block:
       - Subject line
       - Email body
     - Buttons:
       - “Regenerate” (same inputs, new variation)
       - “Copy to Clipboard”
       - “Send Email” (calls `/api/send-email` with that payload)

2. **CSV bulk flow**
   - Page to upload CSV:
     - Drag-and-drop zone + “Browse file” button
     - Small helper text listing required headers: `first_name, last_name, title, company, email, linkedin_url, notes`
   - After upload, display a table:
     - Columns: Name, Title, Company, Email, LinkedIn URL, Status, Preview
     - Status states: “Pending”, “Generating…”, “Ready”, “Sent”, “Error”
   - When user clicks “Generate for All”:
     - Send parsed rows to `/api/generate-batch`
     - Backend processes concurrently (Promise.allSettled or a simple queue) and returns generated emails
     - Update each row with:
       - A compact preview (first 1–2 lines)
       - “View / Edit” button that opens a modal with the full email and editable textarea
   - At top-right, show:
     - “Select All” checkbox
     - “Send Selected” button
   - On send:
     - Call `/api/send-email` with the selected IDs/payloads
     - Update status to “Sent” or “Error” per row

## Basho email prompt logic

In the backend, create a function like `buildBashoPrompt(prospect, linkedinData, companySignals)` that generates a system + user prompt for the LLM. The AI should:

- Use ZoomInfo-style Basho best practices:
  - Lead with an ultra-specific trigger from LinkedIn or company news
  - Describe the pain/COI in the prospect’s own context (role, team, industry)
  - Only then mention the solution/value proposition
  - Close with a clear, specific CTA with 2–3 time slots
- Accept tuning parameters:
  - `tone`: `"casual" | "professional" | "hyper-personal"`
  - `length`: `"short" | "medium"`
- Return structured JSON:
  - `{ subject: string; body: string; }`

Use a mock LLM implementation initially but structure the code so a real AI provider call can be dropped in easily.

## UI / UX requirements

- Overall vibe:
  - Clean, modern, SaaS-like dashboard UI
  - Primary colors:
    - Background: #000000 or near-black
    - Foreground text: #FFFFFF
    - Accent color: a single, subtle highlight (e.g., #00D1FF or another single accent that can be changed in a theme file)
  - High contrast, but not harsh; plenty of whitespace and padding
- Layout:
  - Left sidebar with app name and navigation:
    - Logo text: “Basho Studio” (placeholder)
    - Nav items: “Single Email”, “Bulk Campaigns”, “Settings”
  - Top bar:
    - Environment indicator (“Sandbox” badge)
    - User avatar placeholder
  - Main content cards:
    - Rounded corners
    - Soft drop shadows
    - Use a max-width for main forms for readability
- Components to design well:
  - File upload card with progress / status
  - Result table with chip-style badges for statuses
  - Modal for editing a generated email, with:
    - Subject input
    - Body textarea
    - “Save Changes”, “Regenerate”, “Cancel”
  - Toast notifications for:
    - “Emails generated successfully”
    - “Email send failed”
- Make it responsive and mobile-friendly:
  - On small screens, stack the cards and table
  - Hide non-critical columns behind a “Details” drawer

## Code organization

- Use a monorepo-like structure inside the repl if possible:
  - `/frontend` for React app
  - `/backend` for Express API
- Or a single repo but clearly separated folders:
  - `/src/frontend/*`
  - `/src/backend/*`
- Add clear README with:
  - How to run the backend
  - How to run the frontend
  - How to configure `.env` for AI provider + email provider (mock keys)
- Add placeholder environment variable usage:
  - `AI_API_KEY`
  - `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY`

## Concurrency and performance

- For `/api/generate-batch`:
  - Implement concurrent generation with a configurable concurrency limit (e.g., 5–10 at a time)
  - Use async/await and Promise pools so multiple prospects are processed in parallel
- Clearly separate:
  - Data enrichment (LinkedIn/company info)
  - Prompt building
  - LLM call
  - Email send

## Developer experience

- Use TypeScript types for:
  - `Prospect`
  - `LinkedinProfile`
  - `GeneratedEmail`
- Include basic error handling and logging:
  - Return helpful error messages to the frontend
  - Surface per-row errors in the table

Please generate:

1. All frontend and backend code files
2. A minimal but beautiful dark SaaS UI matching the brand requirements
3. A seed example CSV file for testing
4. Instructions in the README on how to:
   - Run the app locally in Replit
   - Plug in a real AI API key
   - Plug in a real email provider later

Aim for production-quality structure and clean, readable code so it’s easy to extend with real LinkedIn/ZoomInfo/Salesforce integrations later.
